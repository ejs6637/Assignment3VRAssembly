CSC 461/592 - Assignment 3: VR Assembly

Team: Enrique Segoviano and Miles Hudock
VR Assembly: In this scene, the player assembles a car from scratch using 9 objects. 
The instructions to create the vehicle are clearly visible using a canvas with red lettering. 
Using the VR controllers, the player can grab the various objects and assemble them according to the canvas's instructions, 
with the grabbable and snappable scripts added to each part. This is made possible due to the use of sphere colliders/collision that
"snaps" the parts to the body of the car that is on the table. The assembly process is finished once the car is complete and all of the
parts are connected to their respective points.
